README for e2fsprogs/patches

This directory contains patches required for use with Lustre that are
for a specific e2fsprogs version, as shown in e2fsprogs-version.patch,
in the order specified by "series".  Some of the patches here may be
"historical" in the sense that they have already been added to the
upstream e2fsprogs repository since this release, but they are not in
any official e2fsprogs release so are included here for reference.

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to have an SRPM that doesn't have the
patches applied, because the patches change the "configure" script, and
that in turn changes the .spec file (built from .spec.in) and that is
sourced by rpmbuild before the patches are applied...
